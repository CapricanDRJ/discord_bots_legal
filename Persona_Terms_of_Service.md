This includes, but is not limited to, any legal claims, liabilities, costs, or expenses resulting from the creation or use of content that violates laws or the rights of others. The botâ€™s creators, operators, and associated entities bear no responsibility for any illegal or harmful actions taken by users through the use of the bot.
