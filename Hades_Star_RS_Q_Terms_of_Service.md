# Terms of Service  

## **1. Introduction**  
- **Service Description**: "Hades' Star RS Q" (the "Bot") is a Discord bot designed to facilitate **Red Star queue coordination and leaderboard tracking** for the game Hades' Star. The Bot processes **publicly available data** from Discord and Hades’ Star to provide queue management, statistical analysis, and automation features. The Bot does **not collect, store, or process personal data**, nor does it perform any form of identity verification. Some **aggregated data may be uploaded to GitHub** for public accessibility.  
- **Acceptance of Terms**: By using "Hades' Star RS Q", you agree to these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Bot.  

## **2. User Responsibilities**  
- **Account Requirements**: No personal account is required to use the bot.  
- **User Conduct**: Users must not misuse the bot or use it for illegal activities.  

## **3. Usage Restrictions**  
- **Prohibited Activities**: Users must not exploit the bot for unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or any activity that violates Discord’s Terms of Service or the policies of Hades’ Star.  
- **Termination of Service**: We reserve the right to terminate access to the bot for violating these terms.  

## **4. Data Handling & Privacy Considerations**  
- **Public Data Processing**: The Bot processes **only publicly available data** from Discord and Hades’ Star. It does **not collect, store, or process personal data** of any kind.  
- **No Identity Verification**: The Bot does **not verify user identities**. It assumes that the **Discord IDs and obfuscated Hades’ Star IDs provided by their respective platforms are correct**. Any user attempting to associate their Discord ID with their Hades’ Star name does so **without verification from the Bot**.  
- **GitHub Data Uploads**: Some processed data may be **uploaded to GitHub** for public access, such as aggregated queue statistics, leaderboards, or analytical data. Once uploaded, this data is subject to **GitHub’s data retention policies**. The Bot has **no control over historical GitHub revisions** and **cannot remove previously uploaded data**.  
- **Data Ownership**: Users acknowledge that any public data uploaded to GitHub is **not owned by the Bot** and that the Bot is **not responsible for verifying the accuracy or authenticity of publicly shared data**.
- **Third-Party Responsibility**: Any user identification is determined solely by **Discord and Hades’ Star**, not this Bot. The Bot does **not control, modify, or verify** any user data provided by these services. Users concerned about privacy should address their concerns **directly with Discord or Hades’ Star**.

## **5. Intellectual Property**  
- **Ownership**: The bot and its underlying technology are owned by Backwoods Byte Builders.  
- **License Grant**: Users are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the bot in accordance with these terms.  

## **6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability**  
- **No Warranty**: The Bot is provided **“as is” and “as available”**, without warranties of any kind, **either express or implied**. We do not warrant that:
  1. The Bot will function uninterrupted, secure, or error-free;
  2. The results obtained from using the Bot will be accurate or reliable;
  3. Any issues with the Bot will be corrected.
- **Data Accuracy & Availability**: We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, or availability of data processed by the Bot.  
- **Limitation of Liability**: In no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:  
  1. Your use or inability to use the bot;  
  2. Any unauthorized access to or use of our **publicly accessible data**;  
  3. Any interruption, modification, or cessation of the bot's functionality;  
  4. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities affecting the bot.  
- **No Personal Data Liability**: The Bot does not store personal data. It processes **only Discord IDs and obfuscated Hades' Star IDs**, which cannot be used to directly identify an individual. **Hades' Star IDs are obfuscated and non-identifiable**, while Discord IDs are used solely for queue functionality and remain within Discord's ecosystem.

## **7. Modifications to the Service and Terms**  
- **Right to Modify**: We may modify these terms and the bot's functionality at any time.  
- **Continued Use as Acceptance**: If you continue using the bot after changes are posted, you accept the revised terms.  

## **8. Governing Law**  
- **Applicable Law**: These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the **laws of Canada**, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any legal disputes shall be resolved **exclusively in the courts of Canada**.

## **9. Indemnification**  
- **Indemnity**: You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and our and their respective officers, directors, and employees, from any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, or fees arising from:  
  1. Your violation of these terms;  
  2. Your use of the bot;  
  3. Any disputes arising from data provided by third-party services (e.g., Discord, Hades’ Star, GitHub).  

## **10. Severability**  
- **Partial Invalidity**: If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect.  

## **11. No Waiver**  
- **Preservation of Rights**: Failure to enforce any part of these terms does not constitute a waiver of our rights.
