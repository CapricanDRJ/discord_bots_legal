# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction
- **Overview**: This policy describes how "Persona" handles user data.
- **Scope of the Policy**: This policy applies to all users of the bot.

## 2. Information We Collect
- **Prompts and Messages**: Persona collects user prompts and messages to generate responses using ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI.
- **Violation Logs**: Prompts that violate the bot's terms of service are recorded for review but are securely stored.
- **Non-Personal Information**: No other personal information is intentionally collected, apart from the Discord-specific personas and violation-related messages.

## 3. How We Use the Information
- **Generating Responses**: User prompts are shared with ChatGPT, a service provided by OpenAI, to generate text responses, which is the primary function of Persona.
- **Violation Review**: Recorded prompts that violate terms are reviewed to ensure compliance with our usage policies.

## 4. Sharing of Information
- **With Third Parties**: Prompts are shared with OpenAI, a third-party service provider, as part of the text generation process. No other user data is shared with third parties.
- **Legal Requirements**: Data may be disclosed if required by law.

## 5. Data Security
- **Security Measures**: Prompts and messages, particularly those flagged for violating terms, are stored securely to protect user data.
- **No Personal Data Storage**: Apart from specific Discord personas and violation logs, no personal data is stored.

## 6. User Rights
- **Opt-out**: Users can stop using Persona's services at any time. Since no personal data is stored or collected by the bot itself, there is no data to delete or stop collecting. Prompts are only forwarded to ChatGPT for response generation and are not retained by the bot.
- **Deletion of Created Personas**: Users have the right to delete any personas they have created within the bot at any time. Once deleted, this information is permanently removed from our systems.

## 7. Changes to this Policy
- **Policy Updates**: We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated via the bot or the associated platform.
