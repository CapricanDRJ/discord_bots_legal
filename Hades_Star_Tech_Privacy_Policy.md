# Hades' Star Tech Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information through the Hades' Star Tech bot ("the bot"). By using the bot, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this policy. The bot is provided as a non-commercial community tool and is not intended to collect, process, or link any personally identifiable information under Canadian privacy legislation.

## 2. Data Collection

- **Discord User ID**: We collect and store your Discord User ID to link your settings and interactions with the bot.
- **Tech Levels**: The bot records tech levels that you input related to the Hades' Star game. This data is stored only for the purpose of interaction and sharing with others as per your preferences.
- **Profile Data**: You can create, update, and delete profiles. You can also choose who can see your tech levels via the `/corp` command.

### 2.1 Limited API Access

A restricted API feature is available to a small number of approved users for server-specific administrative use. API responses are scoped only to users who have voluntarily shared their data with the relevant Discord server. No broader access is permitted, and identity verification is not performed.


## 3. Data Usage

- **/alt Command**: This command allows you to create, change or clear your shared profile.
- **/corp Command**: This command allows you to control which discord servers you share your data with.

## 4. Data Retention

You can reset all data associated with your account, including tech levels and shared profiles, by using the `/alt` command. API access does not change data retention policies and respects all user-controlled sharing settings.

## 5. Service Discontinuation

The bot, its server, or related services may be discontinued at any time without prior notice. Users should not rely on the bot for any critical data storage or functions.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on the bot's repository or communicated via the bot's interface.
